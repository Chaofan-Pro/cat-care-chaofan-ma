## Overview

What is your app? Give a brief description in a couple of sentences.
### Problem Space
I have became a cat owner recently, and immediately I realise I need an app to document my cat information cause it is very diffcult for me to memorize everything. 
The main reason for this is cat doesn't speak English. I can not ask them which food they like more or how old they will be next week. Most importantly, cat is a very pain endure animal, and they definitely will not tell me if they feel sick in any language that I understand. In a lot of cases, when the owner realise their cats is sick the cat alreay develop very serious symptom which could be prevent by frequently monitor cats' health situation like their weight, their toilet event so that the cats can be taken to vet eariler. 

Why is your app needed? Give any background information around any pain points or other reasons.
