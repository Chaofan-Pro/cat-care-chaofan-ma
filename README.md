# Project Title

Cat Care üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

## Overview

"Cat Care" is an app designed for cat owners to easily document and track important aspects of their cats' well-being, such as toilet habits, vet appointments, and food preferences. The app aims to help owners provide better care and stay organized, ensuring their cats' health and happiness are closely monitored.

### Problem Space

As a new cat owner, I quickly realized the need for an app to track my cat's information because it's hard to remember everything. I‚Äôm sure other cat owners can relate. 
As we know, cats can‚Äôt communicate in English, so I can't ask them about their favorite food or how old they‚Äôll be next week. Most importantly, cats are incredibly resilient and won‚Äôt express when they‚Äôre feeling unwell in a way I can easily understand. By the time many owners notice their cat is sick, the symptoms may already be quite serious. Regularly monitoring their health‚Äîsuch as tracking their weight and bathroom habits‚Äîcan help identify potential issues early, ensuring they can see a vet sooner. 
In short, having an app to record all relevant cat information is essential for every cat owner.

### User Profile

The Cat Care app is designed for cat owners with one or more cats. After registering an account, users can create individual profiles for each of their cats. If the project is successful and other pet owners want to use the app, I plan to introduce categories for different types of animals. This way, pet profiles can be customized accordingly‚Äî for example, dog owners could track their dog‚Äôs daily walks.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

- home page (login/create new account)
- cats profile overview(display photo, name)(click to enter different cat profile)
- cat profile(with link to cat food log and catlender)
